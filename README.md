Context
The types of financial products used by the public are more varied. One financial product that is well-known to the public is term deposits. The term deposit mechanism is that a customer deposits a sum of money at a bank or a financial institution, and the money can only be withdrawn after a certain period of time. As compensation, customers will be given a fixed interest according to the nominal amount of money deposited.

Nevertheless, as business entities with financial products and respective customers, banks still have to compete to not lose customers. One of the ways to acquire new customers is by conducting a marketing campaign.
